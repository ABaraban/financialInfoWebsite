# Creative Project for WashU course Rapid Prototyping and Development

This website utilizes iex cloud api to display financial data. From that data, we calculated popular financial metrics like volatility, average price. The site also has a database so that users can login and see the performance of their portfolio. For logging in, we used security best practices like salting and hashing passwords. We also used Plotly to display professional financial plots for users to visualize stock price over time. I created this website with Henry Shuster.
